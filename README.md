# typewriter

Like a miniature version of [Zen](https://atom.io/packages/zen), this package improves the writing experience in Atom:

* Centered layout
* No gutter
* No scrollbar (unless you hover over the editor)
* But with tabs, tree-view etc.
* Enables soft-wrapping*

Works automatically with Markdown.

\* I intend to add some flexibility there, but right now it doesn't really make sense without this.
