# typewriter-wotw

This is an active fork of
[braver/typewriter](https://github.com/braver/typewriter).

## Improves the writing experience in Atom.

 - Centered layout
 - No gutter
 - Keeps tabs, tree-view, minimap, and etc.
 - Enables soft-wrapping for selected scopes
 - Enable for all file scopes or for the scopes you select

**NOTE:** Variable width fonts are not currently supported. Some fonts may
work, but others will trail out of view and force Atom to scroll horizontally.

## Documentation

Typewriter uses Atom's `Settings > Editor > Preferred Line Length` setting to
set the width of the centered column. 

By default it works for (GF-)Markdown, Latex and MediaWiki files. You can
change what file scopes enable the typewriter plugin in the settings or have it
enabled for all file scopes.
