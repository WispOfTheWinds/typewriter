# typewriter

## Improves the writing experience in Atom:

* Centered layout
* No gutter
* No scrollbar (unless you hover over the editor)
* But keeps the tabs, tree-view, minimap etc
* Enables soft-wrapping for selected scopes
* Enable for all file scopes or for the scopes you select

By default it works for (GF-)Markdown, Latex and MediaWiki files. You can change what file scopes enable the typewriter plugin in the settings or have it enabled for all files scopes.
